   - Initial visit context capture
   - Unique patient identifiers with keyPair generation

6. Real-time Collaboration Foundation
   - WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
   - Session management for multi-doctor collaboration
   - Message persistence in database
   - Secure message handling and storage

7. Platform Navigation & Legal Framework
   - Global footer navigation

   - Privacy Policy page structure
   - Contact page integration
   - Consistent navigation across authenticated and public routes

## Current Architecture

### Frontend
- React + TypeScript
- Modern component architecture using shadcn/ui
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Accessibility features (TTS, color indicators)
- Standardized layout components (Footer, Navigation)
- Route protection based on authentication state

### Backend
- Express + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- WebSocket server for real-time features
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- HIPAA-compliant data handling

### Security
- Session-based authentication
- CSRF protection
- Secure password hashing
- Role-based access control
- Environment variable security

## Database Schema
Current tables:
- users (authentication + role management)
- patients (core patient data + FHIR integration)
- medical_interactions (diagnostic history)
- collaboration_sessions (real-time collaboration)
- session_participants (doctor participation tracking)
- collaboration_messages (real-time communication)

## Environment Requirements
Required secrets:
- DATABASE_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- (Future) FHIR_API_CREDENTIALS

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: FHIR Integration
1. Implement FHIR standard compliance
   - Connect to FHIR providers
   - Implement OAuth2 for FHIR
   - Automatic record updates

### Priority 2: Security Enhancements
1. Implement HIPAA Compliance Features
   - Audit logging
   - Encryption at rest
   - Access control matrices

2. Add Multi-factor Authentication
   - SMS/Email verification
   - Hardware token support
   - Recovery procedures

### Priority 3: Analytics Dashboard
1. Implement Analytics Features
   - Aggregate anonymous diagnostic data
   - Treatment success rates
   - Pattern recognition in diagnoses

## Development Guidelines
- All new features must maintain HIPAA compliance
- Real-time features should use WebSocket infrastructure
- Patient data must be encrypted at rest
- Role-based access control for all endpoints
- Follow provided frontend component structure
- Maintain diagnostic assistant chat patterns
